# Contribute

**I want to emphasize that I do not invite anyone to use Pixel Wrangle in productions that require stability above all else at this time.**

This project is in its early stages, so it is very likely that you will encounter bugs and that breaking changes will occur in the first iterations.

Any RFE is obviously welcome via the dedicated section on the GitHub repo. However, I cannot guarantee flawless responsiveness at this time in terms of bug fixes and the implementation of new features (but I will do my best).

On the other hand, if anyone is interested in helping me make this project a reality, I would be delighted to exchange and collaborate on this topic. Despite the fact that TD .tox are binaries, it is still possible to load scripts from the outside, so finally quite a few things are externalizable (including the most awkward Python scripts to date).

Available to exchange, preferably via [GitHub](https://github.com/miu-lab/Pixel-Wrangle), or by email at the following address: studio.miu.lab@gmail.com
