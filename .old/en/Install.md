# Install

## Prerequisites

The only thing you definitely need to get started is a **recent version of Touchdesigner (builds 2022.XX and later)** installed on your machine.

**If you don't have a license, you can still use Touchdesigner with a 'NON-COMMERCIAL' license**. These versions have the vast majority of features and are currently capable of running Pixel-Wrangle.

**Touchdesigner can be downloaded by following this [link](https://derivative.ca/download)**, it will give you an overview of the different license models.

Optionally, you can [download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) if you want to update future versions of Pixel Wrangle directly through your Terminal.

Finally, if you want to take advantage of the documentation (in Markdown) in the best conditions, you can [download Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). You will have access to it independently of your internet connection with a nice interface.

## Documentation

Si vous souhaitez accéder à la documentation en local et dans les meilleures conditions comme évoqué plus tôt, vous pouvez [télécharger Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

You can then open a "vault" (vault: Obsidian terminology for designating a file and folder architecture in markdown).

The documentation vault is stored in the 'doc' folder at the root of the project, you can open it directly in Obsidian
Path: **C:\\Users\\<*YOUR-USER-ACCOUNT-NAME*>\\Documents\\Derivative\\Palette\\Pixel-Wrangle\\doc**

## Updating the Touchdesigner Palette
